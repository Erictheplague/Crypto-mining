Everything to know about cryptocurrency  mining


This are the mining algos in the cryptocurrency world

[X11 algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/X11&ved=2ahUKEwiGlvur5vD3AhVFz4UKHWm9AdYQFnoECAQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1kTkDS1tNwSiQlbWgWAccI)
The clue is in the name – X11 algorithm is basically a mining algorithm which takes eleven other algorithms and stitches its altogether into a single mining algorithm. Its constituent algorithms are: Blake Bmw Cubehash Echo Groestl Jh ...

[Scrypt algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/Scrypt&ved=2ahUKEwjoueXi5fD3AhWW0YUKHZE_Bs8QFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw07htni6xSy0KB7fVHXRhMn)
The defining characteristic of Scrypt is that mining it uses a lot of memory, and that it also takes a lot time to perform selection. Scrypt is used when mining cryptocurrency and Scrypt makes it more difficult for ASIC miners to compete in mining a ...

[Ethash algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/Ethash&ved=2ahUKEwjEy8_g5vD3AhVNyRoKHYaXDUwQFnoECCcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3hdzcc9L2KCl8tbSZT-R62)
All Ethereum-based coins use Ethash algorithm. Ethash is a tweak of SHA3-256, SHA3-512 algorithms to try and make mining more resistant to ASICs, but still easy enough so that the network can easily verify it. It’s a proof-of-work algorithm, th...

[Equihash algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Equihash)
Dmitry Khovratovich and Alex Biryukov created and developed the EQUIHASH algorithm. Biryukov is a professor from the University of Luxemburg, working in computer science. Khovratovich works independently as a post-doctorate researcher with a focus on...

[CryptoNight Algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/CryptoNight)
The CryptoNight algorithm is CryptoNote and Bytecoin’s (BCN) proof-of-work algorithm and it was designed to allow CPU miners to work on equal terms. It’s not about driving a wedge between PC and ASIC miners, rather it’s about alloca...

[The Dagger-Hashimoto Algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/Dagger-Hashimoto)
The Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm must have the most heroic-sounding name of them all. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work algorithm called Ethash, and the Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm was the first version of that. Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum team created...

[SHA256 Algorithm](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256)
The NSA designed the SHA-256 algorithm along with the other SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions. The initials stand for Secure Hash Algorithm. A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical operation that runs on digital information.
